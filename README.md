# PartofSpeechTagging
Part of Speech Tagging Use several techniques, including table lookups, n-grams, and hidden Markov models, to tag parts of speech in sentences, and compare their performance.


This project demonstrates text processing techniques that allow you to build a part of speech tagging model. You will work with a simplelookup table, and progressively add more complexity to improve the model using probabilistic graphical models. Ultimately you’ll be using a Python package to build and train a tagger with a hidden Markov model, and you will be able to compare the performances of all these models in a dataset of sentences.
